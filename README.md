### Environment variables

Some default env varialbes are provided by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html). Custom variables should be prefixed with `VITE_` to expose them to the code.

Note on `.env` files:

- `.env.production` for production-specific variables
- `.env.development` for development-specific variables
- `.env` for all other environment variables
